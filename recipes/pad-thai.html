        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple vegan Pad Thai, likely far from authentic. I should come up with a better name for it, but for now it is Pad Thai</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 oz. brown rice noodles</li>
            <li>8 oz. firm tofu</li>
            <li>Cornstarch, for tossing the tofu in</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings, like garlic poweder, for the tofu</li>
            <li>Olive oil spray, for the tofu</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons PB2 peanut butter powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup peanuts, chopped</li>
            <li>Veggies of choice, roasted or steamed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook brown rice noodles according to instructions.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, dice or tear the tofu into bite sized pieces</li>
            <li>Toss the tofu in cornstarch until well coated. To get it to stick, it helps to keep the tofu somewhat damp. You can also season with choice of spices at this step.</li>
            <li>Put onto air fryer basket and spritz with the olive oil. Fry at 400 degrees for 12 minutes or until crispy enough for your liking.</li>
            <li>To make the sauce, combine soy sauce, lime juice, peanut butter powder, and brown sugar.</li>
            <li>After noodles are finished cooking, strain and return to pot. Add the noodles and toss with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Put the noodles back onto heat until the sauce is thickened. Be sure to stir continuously so the noodles do not stick.</li>
            <li>Once tofu is finished, put into the noodles and toss to coat with sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve topped with the peanuts.</li>
        </ol>
