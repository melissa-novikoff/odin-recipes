        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious vegan lasagna made with Impossible grounds, vegan cheeses, and a homemade tomato sauce.</p>
        <p>Though a labor of love, it makes enough to feed a small crowd (or to have leftovers for days) so the effort is well worth it!</p>

            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped parsley, divided</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 oz. Kite Hill ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 bottle of Miyoko's Pourable Mozzarella</li>
            <li>1 brick Violife Parmesan, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large Dutch oven, cook sausage, grounds, onion, and garlic over medium heat until cooked through and browned.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water, and stir everything together.</li>
            <li>Add sugar, basil, fennel seeds (if using), Italian seasoning, 2 teaspoons salt, pepper, and 2 Tablespoons parsley, and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Simmer, covered, for at least 1½ hours, stirring occasionally. I usually try to simmer for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>If using regular lasagna noodles, cook according to package instructions and drain.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, remaining parsley, and ½ teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F.</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange a single layer of noodles over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Pour on third of the mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Spoon 1½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
