        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>A very simple burrito bowl, based off of Qdoba bowls. You can add whatever you want to make it to your liking.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 15 oz. pinto beans</li>
            <li>Seasonings such as cumin, garlic powder, etc. for pinto beans</li>
            <li>1/4 cup TVP rehydrated in vegan chicken or beef broth</li>
            <li>Taco seasoning</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked rice, any type works</li>
            <li>5 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>Olive oil spray</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>Toppings such as vegan cheese, salsa, avocado, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Empty can of pinto beans with liquid into small pot. Season to your liking; I usually do cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and salt.</li>
            <li>Heat the beans until bubbling, then keep warm.</li>
            <li>Add reydrated TVP to a heated pan sprayed with olive oil. Season with taco seasoning.</li>
            <li>Heat the TVP until it is slightly dried. Be careful not to burn it or dry it out too much.</li>
            <li>Cut the tortillas into wedges, then place into air fryer basket. I usually do not care if they overlap, but you can do two batches if you want them more evenly crisped.</li>
            <li>Spray with olive oil and sprinkle salt evenly on top.</li>
            <li>Air fry at 375 degrees for around 8-10 minutes. They burn fast, so be sure to keep an eye on them.</li>
            <li>To assemble the bowls, split the beans and TVP into two bowls. Add 1/2 cup rice to each. Top with desired toppings, and serve with the chips.</li>
        </ol>
